			<h3>Who?</h3>
			<p>Hi there, my name is LI, Xin. I am more or less a
				computer geek living in Mountain View, California, USA.

			<p>You may have noticed &quot;Phantasm Studio&quot; here. It is my
				&quot;official&quot; studio name at Dreamland Computing, which was an organization that shares
				computer technology between the group until I have completed my High School, which gave me
				some important experiences and made many good friends.</p>
			<p>I enjoyed music (specifically, classical music), stamp collection, and
				mathematics (Don't tell me if you are sick of this, I said I liked it, not that you have
				to like it too :-) ), astronomy, art design, as well as my major.  Recently, I find myself
				enjoy <a href="http://g2.delphij.net/main.php">photography</a> a bit, also,
				I enjoy swimming during my spare time.</p>
			<p>As someone who blows things up (hey, ain't it evil Xin?) in his early age, I am eager to know OS
				Kernel Internals, Distributed Computing Systems especially P2P systems, and information
				security.  My life is not full of these nuts, of course, but I enjoy solving problems that
				are really challenging.</p>
			<p>I could not get on well with everyone, but I would like to be your friend.</p>
			<p>Share more bits about me... I can speak English, Mandarin, and <a href="http://www.esperanto.net/">
				Esperanto</a>. It will be nice if you can talk Esperanto, too :-)  I am eager to learn some
				other languages as time permits.</p>

			<h3>What?</h3>
			<p>Presently I am working as a full time FreeBSD developer.</p>
			<p>I am a <a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org">FreeBSD</a> committer since September 14, 2004.
				Presently I have write access to all FreeBSD trees, which includes the src/, doc/ and
				ports/ tree.  My primary focus is on the File System, the Virtual Memory System,
				mostly on stability, performance as well as code cleanness.  I am a member of the
				FreeBSD <a href="mailto:secteam@FreeBSD.org">security team</a> and
				<a href="mailto:ports-security@FreeBSD.org">ports security team</a>.</p>
			<h3>Academic life</h3>
			<p>I have received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science in July, 2004.
				Before that, I was an undergraduate student of <a href="http://www.bjut.edu.cn/college/jsjxy/Parts/Students/undercourses.htm">
				Computer Science and Technology</a>, at the <a href="http://www.bjut.edu.cn/college/jsjxy/">
				School of Computer Science</a> under <a href="http://www.bjut.edu.cn">Beijing
				University of Technology</a>. I used to be a student at the <a href="http://www.rdfz.cn">
				High School</a> affiliated to <a href="http://www.ruc.edu.cn">Renmin University of China</a>.</p>
			<p>I am a member of the <a href="http://www.acm.org/">Association for Computing Machinery</a> and the <a href="http://www.usenix.org/">Advanced Computing Systems
				Association</a>.</p>
			<p>I am a <a href="http://www.he.net/">HE.net</a>
				<a href="http://ipv6.he.net/certification/scoresheet.php?pass_name=delphij">certified IPv6 Sage</a>
				and yes, this site runs on IPv6.</p>
			<h3>What I have done</h3>
			<p>I got actively involved in computer science related activities during my High
				School and University life. I have fortunately begun my computing life
				much earlier than peer groups, and earned wide recognize of my
				expertise.</p>
			<p>I was principal technical consultant of networking security technology at High
				School, and used to be president at Students' Association of Computer Machinery
				at School of Computer Science under my University.</p>
			<p>During my university campus life I have been involved with many practical
				projects including designing and implementing a chunk of MIS and CMS systems
				based on both Windows &reg; and UNIX &reg;-alike operating systems. My programming
				and debugging experiences has earned me good reputation and I was the most
				trusted technical consult in my local development group. While there, I have
				organized many events, projects on practice and got awarded with several scholarships,
				including two times to award as "Excellent Students' Cadre".</p>
			<p>I have also received <a href="http://www2.ccw.com.cn/04/0408/a/0408a24_2.asp">2004
				China Computer World Scholarship</a> and 2003 Kitagawa Scholarship for my
				contribution on technical research at university.</p>
			<p>I used to be a regular member of ACM/ICPC representative team of my university
				and get participated twice in 2002's Beijing and Xi'an ACM/ICPC contests
				(Honorable Mention). I have been lecturer in later campus ACM/ICPC interest
				group activities and helped many freshmen to got their way to get anticipated
				in our local ACM/ICPC contests in the university.&nbsp;
				Proudly my university has used our team name, &quot;Pioneer&quot;, as
				the name of intramural ICPC competitions, for a remember of
				our contributions.</p>
			<p>I have jointly founded <a href="http://www.frontfree.net" rel="nofollow">Frontfree Technology
				Network</a>, an academic website on Computer Science and Technology, along
				with my colleagues in 2001. The website has earned its fame because its
				professionalism on academic research and technical applications on wide areas
				of the computer science. When acting as the principal technical officer and
				executive officer during late 2001 to early 2003, I have accomplished my
				mission with a sign of having a more than five times of daily independent
				visitors and significant increase of registered users at the website.</p>
			<p>When working as a principal engineer at the software development teams I got
				involved, I have promoted my beliefs of how to produce high quality software,
				as well as significant techniques to guarantee them. I have published a number
				of related articles and papers on several mediums, including on magazines and
				on website.</p>
			<p>I have paid most of my attention into the research of Computer Science, and what
				have interested me most are: Distributed and Parallel Computing (especially,
				peer to peer and grid computing), Information Security, Artificial
				Intelligence, Compile Time Optimizations, as well as Operating System
				technologies.</p>
			<p>During 2004-2006, I have helped my employer to improve the overall quality of the
				free e-mail system.  By adopting a new storage architecture, we have drastically
				reduced the cost of system.  Also, I have replaced the MX servers (which used
				to run qmail) with <a href="http://www.postfix.org/">postfix</a>,
				also, I have done a new design and implementation of the anti-spam engine which
				have reduced the misidentified spams to improve the user experience about our
				e-mail system, while cutting spam emails more effectively, and is much more
				conformable to existing Internet standards.</p>
			<p>Presently, I am working on the Operating System infrastructure in performance and
				stability aspects.  My current job is to oversee development on large Internet
				system deployment mechanism, to improve FreeBSD's performance, etc.</p>
			<h3>What I am doing</h3>
			<p>As a core member and co-PI of <a href="http://www.freebsdchina.org/">the FreeBSD
					China Community</a> and project principal of <a href="http://www.freebsd.org.cn">the FreeBSD
					Simplified Chinese Project</a>, I played a key role of bringing the
				operating system a better i18n and l10n support, as well as making the
				documentation into the Chinese Language. Currently I am organizing a group of
				volunteers working on the project.</p>
			<p>I am very actively involved with the FreeBSD Project.  I liked the "shut up and
				code" mot from the development server of the FreeBSD Project, and the *BSD
				philosophy.  <a href="http://www.dragonflybsd.org">DragonFly</a>, on the
				other hand, provided a different way of design and implementation approach
				that I am very interested to, and I am working to reduce the diverge between
				the two projects.</p>
			<p>I used to work on a project called "<a href="http://wiki.freebsd.org/TMPFS">TMPFS</a>"
				which is an efficient in-memory file system, and was first shipped with
				FreeBSD 7.0-RELEASE.</p>
			<p>Recently I am working with others to bring a newer <a href=http://hub.opensolaris.org/bin/view/Community+Group+zfs/whatis">ZFS</a>
				to FreeBSD system as well as improvements to FreeBSD hardware drivers,
				userland utilities, as well as system libraries.</p>
			<h3>What do I want</h3>
			<p>I would like to pursue a Ph.D degree in Computer Science specialized in High Performance Computing and
				P2P Computing or other related fields. This will be my main effort in the future years,
				and please contact me if you want to offer some help.</p>
			<h3>Contact</h3>
			<p>The easiest (and preferred) way to contact me is e-mail, the preferred
				address is <a href="mailto:d@delphij.net">d@delphij.net</a>.
				Other addresses <i>may</i> work, but not guaranteed, except those
				got a promise from me.  When you need increased security, e.g.
				in case confidential is needed, PGP encryption or signature is the
				preferred way, however, these technique can only be considered as
				an improvement to plain text e-mails, not an ultimate solution to security.
				You can obtain my PGP public key <a href="delphij.asc">here</a>, as I prefer
				encrypted and signed e-mails. There are several other ways to contact with me,
				for example, you can find me through MSN: <b>delphij@msn.com</b>.</p>
			<p><b style="color: red">NOTE</b> MSN Account and Mobile Phone is only available for those I am aware
				in my real life.  Also, I think it is important to share knowledge with others, so I will
				never answer a single question if I have no idea about who you are.  If you want me to
				answer your question, post it publicly!</p>
			<p>Please feel free to <a href="mailto:d@delphij.net?subject=Question about you">write
				me</a> if you need more information about myself :-)</p>
			<h4>Note about E-Mail Security</h4>
			<p>Recently I was made aware that there <i>is</i> some
			forged e-mail that claims to be from me.&nbsp; Please keep
			in mind that:</p>
			<ul>
				<li type="square">Letters from me is consistent in
				style.&nbsp; Be more careful if you feel it changed!</li>
				<li type="square">An e-mail from my @FreeBSD.org should
				be either a PR, or from hub.FreeBSD.org, or
				freefall.FreeBSD.org.&nbsp; Note that I do not typically
				use my @FreeBSD.org address even for FreeBSD related
				letters.</li>
				<li type="square">The <i><b>preferred</b></i> outgoing address is
					delphij@delphij.net,
					it is protected with <a href="http://www.openspf.org/">
					Sender Permitted From</a> and most e-mails from that
					address <u>are typically PGP signed</u>
					using at least SHA256 as hash algorithm.&nbsp;
					My PGP key is available from the
					<a href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/pgpkeys-developers.html#PGPKEY-DELPHIJ">The
						FreeBSD Handbook</a> and <a href="delphij.asc">here</a>.</li>
				<li type="square">When in doubt, please be sure to get
				PGP signed confirmation from me!</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>A brief history of my website</h3>
			<a href="http://www.freebsd.org/"><img border="0" src="i/powerani.gif" width="171" height="64" align="right" alt="Powered by FreeBSD" /></a>
			<p>I have been on Internet when I was in Middle School. A first version of my own website
				appeared on the Internet in September 1997, which is mostly related to Computer Virus and
				Security Technologies beacause I was so actively involved in these areas these days.
				I have abandoned that since then, as I was made aware that it is not the right things to
				do.  After that, I have re-designed several new versions of the website, but have
				not found someone to host it.  I used to have a guestbook for a short while but that
				was abandoned too.</p>
			<a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer"><img border="0"
			  src="i/valid-xhtml10.png" alt="Valid XHTML 1.0 Transitional" height="31" width="88" align="left" /></a>
			<p>A third re-design of my homepage has been done but never been published. This is a simplified
				re-implement of my second homepage.  On June 2006, the site has been converted to use
				CSS for its layout, and a RSS feed reader is implemented using JavaScript with asynchronous
				XML support found in recent web browsers.</p>
			<h3>Future development of this site</h3>
			<p>My everyday life is busy, so I hardly have some time to improve my own homepage.
				The next generation of this site would provide some new, and let me say,
				more popular features, a newly designed interface to make information
				more easy to find.</p>
